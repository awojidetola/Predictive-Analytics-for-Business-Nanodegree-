# Predicting Catalog Demand

## The Business Problem
As a recent employee of a company manufacturing high-end home goods, last year the company sent out its first print catalog, and is preparing to send out this year's catalog in the coming months. The company has 250 new customers from their mailing list that they want to send the catalog to. The manager has been asked to determine how much profit the company can expect from sending a catalog to these customers. This project aims to predict the expected profit. The management would only send catalog to cusotmers whose expected profit contribution exceeds $10,000.

## Details
- The costs of printing and distributing is $6.50 per catalog.
- The average gross margin (price - cost) on all products sold through the catalog is 50%.
