# Task 1 Overview

A company has 85 grocery stores and is planning to open 10 new stores at
the beginning of the year. All stores use the same store format for selling
their products currently and up till now, the company has treated all
stores similarly. Some stores are suffering from product surpluses and
some from shortages due to this equal treatment. You have been asked to
provide analytical support to make decisions about store formats and
inventory planning.

To remedy this problem, the company wants to introduce different store
formats. Each format will have different project selection to match
demand. Only the Product Selection and Internal Layouts change.

**As a business analyst, you have been asked to:**

1. Determine the optimal number of stores formats based on sales data

2. Determine the Sum Sales Data by StoreID and Year

3. Use percentage sales per category per store for clustering I.e. Category
sales as a percentage of total sales

4. Use only 2015 Sales Data

5. Use a K Means Clustering Model

6. Segment the 85 current stores into different Store Formats
