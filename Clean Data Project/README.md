# Data Clean up Project

## The Business Problem

Pawdacity is a leading pet store in Wyoming with 13 stores and an intention of opening a 14th. As a business analyst, you have been asked to perform analysis by your manager to recomend the city for the newest store based on predicted yearly sales. 

The data provided includes the following:

- The monthly sales data for all of the Pawdacity stores for the year 2010.
- NAICS data on the most current sales of all competitor stores where total sales is equal to 12 months of sales.
- A partially parsed data file that can be used for population numbers.
- Demographic data (Households with individuals under 18, Land Area, Population Density, and Total Families) for each city and county in the state of Wyoming. For people who are unfamiliar with the US city system, a state contains counties and counties contains one or more cities.
- Map of Wyoming Counties.

The aim of this project is to clean the data and make it ready for analysis and prediction.
