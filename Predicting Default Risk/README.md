# Predicting Default Risk
You work in a small bank responsible for determining creditworthy customers, your team gets 200 loan applications per week and approves by hand. Due to a financial scandal that hit a competitive bank last week, there is an influx of new people applying for loans for your bank instead of the other bank in your city. All of a sudden you have nearly 500 loan applications to process this week! Your manager sees this new influx as a great opportunity and wants your team to figure out how to process all of these loan applications within one week. This project analyzes the business problem with an aim of providing a list of creditworthy customers to the manager in 2 days.
