# Task 1: Store Format for Existing Stores

A company has 85 grocery stores and is planning to open 10 new stores at
the beginning of the year. All stores use the same store format for selling
their products currently and up till now, the company has treated all
stores similarly. Some stores are suffering from product surpluses and
some from shortages due to this equal treatment. You have been asked to
provide analytical support to make decisions about store formats and
inventory planning.

To remedy this problem, the company wants to introduce different store
formats. Each format will have different project selection to match
demand. Only the Product Selection and Internal Layouts change.


# Task 2 : Store Format for New Stores
The grocery store chain has 10 new stores opening up at the beginning of the year. The company wants to determine which store format each of the new stores should have. However, we don’t have sales data for these new stores yet, so we’ll have to determine the format using each of the new store’s demographic data.

**We are asked to:**

1. Develop a model that predicts which segment a store falls into based on the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the population that resides in the area around each new store.

2. Use the model to predict the best store format for each of the 10 new stores.

# Task 3 : Forecasting

Fresh produce has a short life span, and due to increasing costs, the company wants to have an accurate monthly sales forecast.
You’ve been asked to prepare a monthly forecast for produce sales for the full year of 2016 for both existing and new stores.
